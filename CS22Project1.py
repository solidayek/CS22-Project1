# CS 22 – Project 1
# Follow these instructions exactly as they are written:
# • Open a project in PyCharm named CS22Project1.
# • Create a Python file in this project named CS22Project1.py.
# • Copy and paste the header from the CS22CommentHeader.docx file in the
# Files area of Canvas and complete the lines for your name, the assignment, and
# the due date.
# • Create a class named Athlete as follows:
# o It has three data attributes: one for a name, one for a country, and one for
# a sport
# o It has a constructor (initializer) to initialize the three data attributes
# o It has accessor (get) and mutator (set) methods for each attribute (six
# methods total)
# • Create a class named TeamSport as follows:
# o It inherits the Athlete class
# o It has two data attributes: one for the position the player plays and one for
# the number of league championships the player won.
# o It has a constructor (initializer) to initialize five data attributes (name,
# country, sport, position, league championships)
# o It has accessor (get) and mutator (set) methods for each of its two
# attributes (four methods total)
# • Create a class named IndividualSport as follows:
# o It inherits the Athlete class
# o It has two data attributes: one for the total winnings of the player and one
# for the number of major championships the player won.
# o It has a constructor (initializer) to initialize five data attributes (name,
# country, sport, winnings, major championships)
# o It has accessor (get) and mutator (set) methods for each of its two
# attributes (four methods total)
# • Create a main() program after all the class definitions and write code for it as
# follows:
# o Create a list named team and make its elements objects of the
# TeamSport class, using the following data for each object:
#  ‘WayneGretzky’,’Canada’,’Hockey’,’Center’,4
#  ‘Tom Brady’,’United States’,’Football’,’Quarterback’,7
#  ‘Lionel Messi’,’Argentina’,’Soccer’,’Forward’,14
# o Create another list named indy and make its elements objects of the
# IndividualSport class, using the following data for each object:
#  ‘Roger Federer’,’Switzerland’,’Tennis’,130594339,20
#  ‘Rory McIlroy’,’Northern Ireland’,’Golf’,125147336,4
# o Using a for loop, display data for each object in the team list in two
# sentences, followed by a blank line.
# o Using a second for loop, display data for each object in the indy list in two
# sentences, followed by a blank line.
#  NOTE: You must use an f-string in all your outputs, especially to
# format dollar amounts with commas and 2 decimal places. Look at
# the CS31Ch2Lab2.pptx file from the Gaddis PowerPoints for
# examples.
